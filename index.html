          <p class="bio">
            Thomas Matthew DeLonge was born in Poway, California, on December
            13, 1975,the son of a mortgage broker mother and an oil company
            executive father.He has a brother named Shon and a sister named
            Kari.His first musical instrument was a trumpet, which he received
            as a Christmas gift at age 11.He originally planned to become a
            firefighter, and participated in the San Diego Cadet Program.He
            first picked up the guitar from a friend at church camp, and became
            preoccupied by the instrument.He received his first guitar as a
            Christmas present from two friends in the sixth grade, which he
            described as a "beat-up, shitty acoustic guitar that was worth about
            $30".In the seventh grade, DeLonge visited a friend in Oregon who
            introduced him to the music of Stiff Little Fingers, the
            Descendents, and Dinosaur Jr.He consequently dyed his hair purple
            and began practicing the guitar loudly in his bedroom. He attempted
            to form a band named Big Oily Men, which was essentially a one-man
            band because its line-up consisted of whomever he could persuade to
            join him for short periods.He first began skateboarding in the third
            grade, and it would consume much of his activity outside of school:
            "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All I did all day long
            was skateboard. It was all I cared about." He and friends would
            begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the
            other half, pranking people in the process. As such, he was an
            average student and later said, "I knew exactly how hard I had to
            work in school. As long as I got that C, I wouldn't try one minute
            extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and
            music."DeLonge's parents were constantly fighting in his formative
            years, culminating in a divorce when he was 18. Shortly thereafter,
            his mother lost her job. He promptly moved out, feeling as though he
            needed to start his own life; his brother was also away at that time
            in the Army, and his departure affected his family: "My mom and
            sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'" Following
            high school, he worked on construction sites, where he drove a
            Diesel truck and handled concrete and piping: "I hated, hated, hated
            my job. You know those people who hate their job? That was me."He
            quit when Blink-182 signed to MCA Records in 1996.

            <li>
              Business
              <br />
              In 2011, DeLonge launched Strange Times, a website devoted to
              extraterrestrial life, paranormal activity, cryptozoology, and
              conspiracy theories. All of DeLonge's business entities exist
              under the RLP moniker, with the exception of Atticus Clothing,
              which was sold in 2005.
            </li>

            <li>
              Film
              <br />
              DeLonge approached filmmaking when he directed the music video for
              the song "This Photograph is Proof (I Know You Know)" by Taking
              Back Sunday in 2004. He was fascinated by the medium, calling the
              process "so artistically satisfying", and he has since worked in
              film on Angels & Airwaves-related projects. In 2014, he
              co-directed the animated short film Poet Anderson: The Dream
              Walker.

            <li>
              Conspiracy theories and aliens
              <br />
              In 2019, the company produced the History Channel television show
              Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation, about the USS
              Nimitz UFO incident, which also features DeLonge. In April 2020,
              the Pentagon officially declassified three videos which had been
              previously leaked by people claiming they showed UFOs; DeLonge had
              previously released the videos through his company in 2017.

          <p class="reason" align="top">The Reason:</p>
          <p class="side_projects">
            In the wake of Blink-182's break-up, DeLonge underwent a complete
            reassessment of his prime concerns—a move "bearing the hallmarks of
            a nervous breakdown"—and went on a three-week "spiritual journey" in
            complete isolation away from his family, contemplating his life,
            career, and future in music. DeLonge felt psychologically hurt by
            the band's dissolution, likening it to a divorce and calling it a
            "traumatic experience" and a "disaster". He had been known for his
            role in the Blink-182 as "the low-brow prankster" and wanted to
            restart his career without worrying whether fans would find him
            funny.
